The usage of LLMs is not specifically prohibited or recommended. However, it is the responsibility of the programmer to:

  - Remove errant comments
  - Ensure the code functions as intended
  - Otherwise clean up the output

While LLMs are a sometimes useful tool, they can not fully understand an entire program at this stage, and therefore code they produce will frequently require changes in order to work with the rest of the existing code base.
